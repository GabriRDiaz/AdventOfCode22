# Advent of Code 22

Hey there! I´ve been participating in Advent of Code 2022. These are my approaches for each problem:

| Day | Problem | Code |
| :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |
| 1  |  [Calorie Counting][Calorie Counting] |  [Day 0][Day 0] |

##### Fav ❤️ this repo if you also think that Advent Of Code should start at day 0 😛
